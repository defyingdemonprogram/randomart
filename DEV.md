### 1. Function prototype with a function pointer parameter:

```c
void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))
```

The function `void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))` takes a function pointer `f` as a parameter. This pointer refers to a function that takes two floating-point values, `x` and `y`, representing coordinates, and returns a `Color`. The `render_pixels` function uses the function pointed to by `f` to compute and render the color for each pixel based on its specific coordinates.

### 2. `fmod` Function in C

The `fmod` function in C calculates the remainder of the division of two floating-point numbers.

**Syntax:**

```c
double fmod(double x, double y);
```

- **`x`**: Dividend (the number to be divided).
- **`y`**: Divisor (the number by which `x` is divided).


The formula for `fmod(x, y)` is:
$$
\text{remainder} = x - \left( \text{floor}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \times y \right)
$$
- It computes the remainder after dividing `x` by `y`, where `floor(x / y)` gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the quotient.
- The remainder has the same sign as the dividend `x`.

**Potential Issues with `fmod`:**

- **Division by Zero**: If `y` is zero, `fmod(x, y)` causes undefined behavior. Always check that `y != 0` before using `fmod`.

### 3. `static_assert`

`static_assert` is a compile-time assertion used in C and C++ to verify conditions during the compilation process. It ensures that certain conditions are met before the program is compiled, helping catch errors early.

**Syntax:**

```c
static_assert(condition, message);
```

- **`condition`**: A compile-time constant expression that must evaluate to `true`. If the condition is `false`, the compiler will generate an error.
- **`message`**: An optional string that will be displayed as an error message if the assertion fails.

**Example:**

```c
static_assert(sizeof(int) == 4, "Size of int must be 4 bytes");
```

In this example, the assertion checks that the size of `int` is 4 bytes. If the condition is false (i.e., the size is not 4), the compiler will generate an error with the provided message.

- `static_assert` is useful for enforcing certain assumptions about the environment, such as data type sizes, compiler versions, or hardware-specific constraints.
- It's a way to prevent the program from compiling if certain critical conditions aren't met.

**Advantages:**
- Catches errors at compile-time instead of runtime.
- Improves code safety by ensuring assumptions about the program's environment hold true.

### 4. `fprintf` vs `printf` vs `sprintf`

- **`printf`**: 
  - Outputs formatted data to the standard output (usually the terminal).
  - It doesn't take a file stream as an argument.
  
  **Example:**
  ```c
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  ```

- **`fprintf`**: 
  - Similar to `printf`, but instead of printing to the standard output, it allows printing to a specific file stream (like a file or stderr).
  - Takes a `FILE*` as its first argument, which specifies where the output is directed.

  **Example:**
  ```c
  FILE *file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
  fprintf(file, "This is written to a file\n");
  fclose(file);
  ```

- **`sprintf`**:
  - Similar to `printf`, but instead of printing the formatted output to the console or a file, it stores the output in a string (a character array).
  - The output is stored in the buffer provided as the first argument.

  **Example:**
  ```c
  char buffer[100];
  sprintf(buffer, "Formatted number: %d", 42);
  printf("Buffer: %s\n", buffer);
  ```

- `sprintf` can be unsafe if the buffer is not large enough to hold the formatted string, which can lead to buffer overflows. Use `snprintf` as a safer alternative.
