### 1. Function prototype with a function pointer parameter:

```c
void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))
```

The function `void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))` takes a function pointer `f` as a parameter. This pointer refers to a function that takes two floating-point values, `x` and `y`, representing coordinates, and returns a `Color`. The `render_pixels` function uses the function pointed to by `f` to compute and render the color for each pixel based on its specific coordinates.

### 2. `fmod` Function in C

The `fmod` function in C calculates the remainder of the division of two floating-point numbers.

**Syntax:**

```c
double fmod(double x, double y);
```

- **`x`**: Dividend (the number to be divided).
- **`y`**: Divisor (the number by which `x` is divided).


The formula for `fmod(x, y)` is:
$$
\text{remainder} = x - \left( \text{floor}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \times y \right)
$$
- It computes the remainder after dividing `x` by `y`, where `floor(x / y)` gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the quotient.
- The remainder has the same sign as the dividend `x`.

**Potential Issues with `fmod`:**

- **Division by Zero**: If `y` is zero, `fmod(x, y)` causes undefined behavior. Always check that `y != 0` before using `fmod`.
