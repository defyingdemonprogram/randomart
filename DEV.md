### Explanation:

```c
void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))
```

The function `void render_pixels(Color (*f)(float x, float y))` takes a function pointer `f` as a parameter. This pointer refers to a function that takes two floating-point values, `x` and `y`, representing coordinates, and returns a `Color`. The `render_pixels` function uses the function pointed to by `f` to compute and render the color for each pixel based on its specific coordinates.
